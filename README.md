I am trying to write my own utilities in python such as a session store for webservers, a redis clone
(with only a subset of features), a build tool (similar to webpack in javascript environment) and any new things 
that interest me. The whole point of having software package managers like pypi, npm etc, is to maximize the code 
reusability then what is the point of reinventing the wheel? you might ask. I think building things from scratch 
helps anyone understand thing in more detail. I also feel this helps us understand many of the existing libraries 
andframeworks in more depth.
